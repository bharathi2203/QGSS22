### Qiskit Global Summer School 2022 [QGSS22]: Quantum Simulations

The Qiskit Global Summer School 2022 is a two-week intensive summer program designed to help students explore the world of quantum computing and its applications. This third-annual summer school will provide a focused introduction to quantum computing and its applications to quantum simulation, with a specific focus on quantum chemistry.

This repository contains labs and assignments completed over the course of the program.


### Labs 

#### Lab 1: Intro to circuit composition and cost

In the first Lab we will start slowly by giving an introduction to simple one qubit gates and show how they can be seen as rotations. We will then take a look at multi qubit gates and see some examples on how they can be used to create entangled states. After that we will apply the knowledge of complexity theory, which we learned in class, to quantum circuits. We will also take another look at the Quantum Fourier Transform as well as how to generate entangled states, with complexity theory in mind.

This lab is meant as an introduction / a repetition of the basics of quantum computation, as well as for introducing some examples of the concepts shown in the lecture to help you to learn them.

#### Lab 2: Advanced circuits

The formalism of quantum information theory can look rather abstract compared to the circuit model of quantum computation. The Qiskit Opflow module aims to bridge the language of quantum information theory with the framework of circuits that is used to run experiments. This will make it seamless to switch back and forth between theoretical ideas and their experimental implementation.

One example that we'll see in some detail is the simulation of the time-evolution of quantum system. Using the Qiskit Opflow module going from the definition of the Hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the system to the experiment implementing a quantum simulation of the dynamics can be done in just a few lines of code!
